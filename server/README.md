This project uses a FHIR compliant server as it's data backend. A sample configuration file can be found in config/config.json.example.

# Config
Copy the config.json.example file to config.json. config.json is not managed by git and will not change if you update to the latest version of iHRIS. The example file has the necessary format and options but will need to be changed to suit your installation. The config file is divided into three parts: development, test, and production. Update the appropriate section based on which server you are installing the software on.

## Definitions

## Elastic
Elasticsearch is used to power your kibana dashboards. To set up the flow from your FHIR server to an Elasticsearch installation, update these fields to include a link to where your Elasticsearch instance is hosted along with a username and password that will allow iHRIS to update the data in your Elasticsearch instance. To learn more about elasticsearch, visit their [official website](https://www.elastic.co/).

```
"elastic": {
  "server": "http://yoursite.com/elasticsearch",
  "username": "username",
  "password": "password",
  "version": "7.5"
}
```

## FHIR
iHRIS uses a FHIR compliant server to manage it's data. Any FHIR compliant server will work but you will need to set one up outside of this application. Once your server has been setup, update the config file to include the link to the server along with a username and password that will allow iHRIS to read/write data to your FHIR server. If you are unfamiliar with the FHIR standard, learn more at [https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html). While any FHIR compliant server will work, [Hapi FHIR](https://hapifhir.io/) is an open source global good.

```
"fhir": {
  "server": "http://your.fhir.server.com",
  "username": "username",
  "password": "password"
}
```

## Kibana
Kibana is used to render dashboards on the frontend. The data in your Kibana dashboards will be synced from your FHIR installation to an Elasticsearch installation. To enable dashboards in your application, provide a link to your kibana installation. To learn more about kibana, visit their [official website](https://www.elastic.co/kibana).

```
"kibana": "http://yoursite.com/kibana"
```

## Structure Definition
When creating custom structure definitions, you need to specify a profile url. It is essential that these profile urls remain consistent. Set the prefix for the profile url in the structure definition config setting.

```
"structureDefinition": "http://ihris.org/fhir"
```

## Port
This setting dictates what port your backend instance will run on.

```
"port": 3000
```

## Origins
In order to secure your application, all requests are rejected except those from origins that you specify. You can specify any number of origins you'd like. The one except to this is the `/site-up` endpoint. This one remains open for monitoring sites to check to see if your application is up.

```
"origins": [
  "http://localhost:8082", "http://www.yoursite.com", "http://www.anotherhostedsite"
]
```

## mHero
mHero is a two-way, mobile phone-based communication system that uses basic text messaging, or SMS, to connect ministries of health and health workers. To enable mHero, you need to setup an [emNutt server](https://github.com/intrahealth/emNutt). You also need to update your configuration file and set the mHero structure definition prefix. This is similar to the structureDefinition setting show above. Learn more about mHero by visiting the [official website](https://www.mhero.org/). This setting is not required if you are not using mHero.

```
"mhero": "http://mhero.org/fhir/StructureDefinition"
```

## emNutt
emNutt is a separate backend server that facilitates communication between iHRIS and your messaging service such as RapidPro. Installation instructions for emNutt can be found on it's [github page](https://github.com/intrahealth/emNutt). This setting is not required if you are not using mHero. To connect your iHRIS installation to your emNutt installation, specify the emNutt credentials as shown below.

```
"emNutt": {
  "server": "http://emnutt.yoursite.com",
  "username": "username",
  "password": "password"
}
```


# Using Docker
After cloning and customizing the configurations run the following commands
```
cd ui
```

Build the image
```
docker image build -t ihris-ui .
```

Run the image (as a background process)
```
docker container run --publish 8000:3000 --detach --name ihris-ui ihris-ui
```

Open this UI from your browser and you should see a page with title: Express
```
http://localhost:8000/
```

Some URLs to test

http://localhost:8000/dashboard/all
http://localhost:8000/user/list
